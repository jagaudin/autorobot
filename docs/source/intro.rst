Introduction
============

**autoRobot** presents a collection of extensions and a set of high-level functions that can be used to automate Robot Structural Analyis (RSA) through its API. RSA presents a COM interface written for a .Net environment. `Python.Net <https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet>`_ provides access to this environment from a regular CPython interpreter. 
This offers the benefit of being able to use CPython scientific librairies like `Numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_ and `Scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ to manipulate the data of a structural model.
